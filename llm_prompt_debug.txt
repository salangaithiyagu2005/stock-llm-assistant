INSTRUCTIONS:
You are advising a swing/position trader who is NOT a daily trader and prefers to hold and average down rather than exit quickly. Only recommend 'Exit' in extreme or long-term negative scenarios. If the prediction is negative, suggest if and how to average down, and under what conditions to consider exiting. Focus on patient, long-term strategies.

1. Analyze the above data and provide your recommendation in the following format:

Action: <Buy/Hold/Average/Exit> (first line, single word)
Confidence: <0-100> (second line, integer only)
Rationale: (2-3 sentences, concise, actionable, and specific for a non-daily trader)

2. Then, provide a summary table with these columns: Factor | Value | Impact (Positive/Negative/Neutral)
   - Include: Last Close, Predicted Next Close, Predicted Next Week, Predicted Month, RSI, MA20, MA50, Support, Resistance, Recent News Sentiment, Trade History Summary

3. Be direct, avoid generic disclaimers, and focus on actionable advice for a patient, non-daily trader.
